OLED Display Holder
-------------------

These 128 x 64 OLED displays can be found very inexpensively (less than $2 
each in quantity). However they aren't great for displays that you sit far
from as they can be tiny and hard to read. My solution is to mount multiple
displays right next to each other to create a single "meta" display.
